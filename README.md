# LD Workbench

LD Workbench is a command-line tool for transforming large RDF datasets using pure SPARQL.

This project is currently in a Proof-of-Concept phase.

## Approach

The main design principes are scalability and extensibility.

### Scalability 

LD Workbench is **scalable** due to its iterator/generator approach:

* the **iterator** component fetches URIs using a SPARQL SELECT query, paginating results using SPARQL `OFFSET` and `LIMIT` (binding each URI to a `$this` variable)
* the **generator** component then runs a SPARQL CONSTRUCT query for each URI ([pre-binding](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/#pre-binding) `$this` to the URI), which returns the transformed result.  

### Extensible 

LD Workbench is **extensible** because it uses pure SPARQL queries (instead of code) for configuring transformation pipelines.
Each pipeline is a sequence of stages; each stage consists of an iterator and generator.

## Configuration

An LD Workbench pipeline is defined with a YAML configuration file. The configuration is validated by a JSON Schema. The schema is part of this repository ([link](https://github.com/netwerk-digitaal-erfgoed/ld-workbench/blob/main/static/ld-workbench.schema.json)). The YAML and JSON Schema combination is tested to work in the VSCode editor.

A pipeline must have a name, one or more stages, and optionally a description. Multiple pipelines can be configured as long as they have unique names. See the [example configuration file](https://github.com/netwerk-digitaal-erfgoed/ld-workbench/blob/main/static/example/config.yml) for a boilerplate configuration file. A visualization of the schema gives more insights on required and optional properties can be [found here](https://json-schema.app/view/%23?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fnetwerk-digitaal-erfgoed%2Fld-workbench%2Fmain%2Fstatic%2Fld-workbench.schema.json).

### Example YAML File For Configuration Options

```yaml
name: MyPipeline
description: Example pipeline configuration
destination: output/result.ttl
stages:
  - name: Stage1
    iterator:
      query: "SELECT ?s ?p ?o WHERE { ?s ?p ?o } LIMIT 100"
      endpoint: "http://example.com/sparql-endpoint"
      delay: "150 ms"
    generator:
      - query: "CONSTRUCT { ?s ?p ?o } WHERE { ?s ?p ?o }"
        batchSize: 50
    destination: output/stage1-result.ttl
  - name: Stage2
    iterator:
      query: file://queries/iteratorQuery.rq

## Installation

1. Install Node.js 20.10.0 or larger, by going to <https://nodejs.org> and following the instructions for your OS.

   Run the following command to test whether the installation succeeded:

   ```sh
   npm --version
   node --version
   ```

2. Install LD Workbench:

   ```sh
   npx @netwerk-digitaal-erfgoed/ld-workbench --init
   ```

   Your workbench is now ready for use.

## Usage

Once installed, an example workbench is present that can be run with the following command:

```sh
npx @netwerkdigitaalergoed/ld-workbench
```

### Configuring a workbench pipeline

To keep your workbench workspace clean, create a folder for each pipeline that contains the configuration and the SPARQL Select and Construct queries. Use the `static` directory for this.

Here is an example of how your file structure may look:

```sh
ld-workbench
|-- static
|   |-- my-pipeline
|   |   |-- configuration.yaml
|   |   |-- select.rq
|   |   |-- construct.rq
```

## Development

For local development, the following command should get you going:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/netwerk-digitaal-erfgoed/ld-workbench.git
cd ld-workbench
npm i
npm run compile
```

To start the CLI tool you can use this command:

```sh
npm run ld-workbench -- --configDir static/example
```

Since this project is written in Typescript, your code needs to be transpiled to Javascript before you can run it (using `npm run compile`). With `npm run dev` the transpiler will watch changes in the Typescript code an transpiles on each change.

The configuration of this project is validated and defined by [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org). The schema is located in `./static/ld-workbench-schema.json`. To create the types from this schema, run `npm run util:json-schema-to-typescript`. This will regenerate `./src/types/LDWorkbenchConfiguration.d.ts`, do not modify this file by hand.

## Workflow & Class Descriptions

### Workflow

This figure represents the workflow of the LD Workbench application:

![Workflow of the LD-Workbench application](static/figures/diagram.svg)

A Pipeline can have multiple Stages, specified in the configuration file. A Stage has one Iterator and can have multiple Generators in it's configuration. An Iterator has to be connected to a SPARQL endpoint, when none is specified for the Generator(s), the Generator reuses the same SPARQL endpoint to generate linked data, when a different endpoint is specified in the Generator's configuration, this endpoint is used instead.
